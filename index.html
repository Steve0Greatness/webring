    <h2>How to Join</h2>
    <p>
        Email me <i>steve0greatnessiscool+wr [at] gmail.com</i> with a link to your site
        so that I can make sure you're a good fit for this webring, then I'll let you
        know your slug. Speaking of which, make sure to include something like the
        following on your site:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;a
                href="https://steve0greatness.github.io/webring/sites/:slug:/prev.xhtml"
            &gt;Prev&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;a
                href="https://steve0greatness.github.io/webring"
            &gt;
                &lt;img
                    src="https://steve0greatness.github.io/webring/logo.webp"
                    width="100"
                    height="42"
                /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;a
                href="https://steve0greatness.github.io/webring/sites/:slug:/next.xhtml"
            &gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>
    <p>Just make sure to replace <code>:slug:</code> with your slug.</p>
    <p>Also, it doesn't have to be that specifically, that is just an example.</p>
    <h2>What gets added to the webring?</h2>
    <p>I don't accept the following types of sites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Non-personal websites.</strong> All websites trying to join this webring
            must be a personal website. Wether your're hosting a blog, your artwork, or whatnot.
            It just has to be about you, not an organization, group, or a space of communication.
            Although you are allowed to have something like a guestbook, as long as it's not the
            focus of the site.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No slurs.</strong> Strong language, like swears, are allowed, but if you
            frequently use slurs on your website, I will not let you in the webring.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No anti-queer material.</strong> If you are against the rights or existance
            of those who are queer, then you won't be allowed in.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No blatant racism or sexism.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do not promote cryptocurrency.</strong> I'm not a fan of it. I have
            numorous reasons for this. If you have to ask for my reasons, you're probably not
            a good fit for this webring.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sites created just to host NSFW.</strong> I don't want sites that just
            have adult content. That is not allowed.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Rules once you're in the webring</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Keep up do date with the above rules.</strong> I may not let you know of
            rule changes. But generally, if you didn't break the rules previously, you probably
            won't now.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>You must include the webring links on your site.</strong> Being part of a webring
            is one thing, participation is another thing. If you do not add the webring to your site,
            in a timely manner, I will remove you from the webring. I may give you notice before this,
            but I don't always; if you remove them a short time after I had asked to readd them, for
            one.
    </ul>
    <h3>Can I get removed from the webring?</h3>
    <p>Yes. If I see that you're violating the rules, I may ask you over email to </p>
